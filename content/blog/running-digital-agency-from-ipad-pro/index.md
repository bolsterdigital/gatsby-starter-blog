title: Running a digital agency from an iPad pro

Only a couple of months ago, I decided to try a new iOS App, called Shortcuts (previously known as Workflow). Once I figured out how to use a Shortcut as a Safari web page share extension to post bug reports to Trello with annotated screenshots, I was sold.

Long story short: I’ve been using Shortcuts so intensively, I found myself at the office programming them on my tiny iPhone screen – ignoring my MacBook Pro with external monitor setup for increasingly longer time periods. Enter: the iPad Pro.

## iPad Pro: gearing up
If you’re running a digital agency, doing content creation, marketing or consultancy work, the iPad Pro will probably be just fine. You will need a couple of things, though. Heres my suggestions for necessary hardware:

- Let’s start with the actual iPad Pro. I’d suggest the 11” with 256GB of storage. That’s plenty of room for local files, photos and some media - I keep most of my files in the cloud, including my media library. 
- For typing on-the-go, Apple’s official [Smart Keyboard Folio](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU8G2LL/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-11-inch-ipad-pro-us-english?referrer=https://www.google.nl/) is probably your best bet. It’s certainly an improvement over its previous incarnation. It serves as a case as well.
- When doing serious work at a fixed location – your office desk – you will be better off with a separate Bluetooth Apple Keyboard. 
- I’d also suggest an elevated stand (or some mounted solution like [this one](https://www.goos-e.com/en/)
- Additionally, you could use a separate external monitor that mirrors your iPad screen, using a [USB-C Digital AV adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1K2AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter?referrer=https://www.google.nl/). 
- You could also consider purchasing an Apple Pencil. If you’re doing any kind of illustration work, it is a no-brainer. It’s also great for just rough sketching – and even audio editing apps like Ferrite offer support for the stylus.

Everything combined, you’ll be confronted with a hefty price tag. But our aim is to replace a MacBook Pro (or iMac), which arguably makes it worth the investment.


## Recommended software
Alright, you will need a couple of well-crafted apps. Generally speaking, though, switching to iOS often requires you to take a step back and think about your workflows. Because programs and files tend to be more often out of your field of vision (and because the Files app isn’t that great yet), it will be necessary to create some structures and shortcuts. Here’s a couple of tips.


- Use Shortcuts. You can easily configure Shortcuts as Alfred-style task / app / website launchers, for example.
- Install apps that offer great Shortcuts support or at least use URL schemes, such as Fantastical, Omnifocus, Trello, Working Copy.
- If you are really into automation, you can connect Shortcuts to Zapier. For example, it’s easy to automatically create Harvest projects and Trello boards using details from your Contacts app or an Airbase table.
- Use Siri. You can [type commands to Siri](https://www.imore.com/ios-11-will-let-you-type-queries-siri) (talking out loud to your computer in an agency setting is awkward and annoying).

## Example workflows
Here are a couple of examples:
